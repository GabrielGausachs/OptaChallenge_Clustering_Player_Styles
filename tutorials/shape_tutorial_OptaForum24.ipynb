    "- Role: An individual role, such as LB. Players are associated with roles for a period of time.\n",

    "- Shape: A set of co-occuring outfield roles for the team\n",
    "- Template: Some pre-defined shapes and corresponding roles that we have specified in a manner such that most observed shapes are similar to at least one of the templates"
